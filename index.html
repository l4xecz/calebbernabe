          We advise strongly that you refrain from engaging in any professional activity with him.

          Caleb committed to a paid software implementation with a deadline of his choosing. Assurances were frequent and firm, but progress remained unwitnessed. Once delivery was understood to be impossible, so too became contact with Caleb. All communications were, and continue to be ignored.
